Write concise, technical TypeScript. Follow Standard.js rules.

Use functional, declarative patterns; avoid classes.

Favor loops and small helper modules over duplicate code.

Use descriptive names with auxiliary verbs (e.g. isLoading, hasError).

File layout: exported component → subcomponents → hooks/helpers → static content.
